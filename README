Welcome to the Morzo project.

This is a free software browser MMORPG inspired by the unique and great Cantr II.
It was mainly created because Cantr is down a lot and slow when it's not.
Cantr is also quite closed and restricted, I want something open and untamed.

Contribution
	As a developer, fork the project and set up your own server.
	1) I want to make sure setting up a fresh server is as easy as possible.
	2) Having people work on separate servers means you're out of each others hair.
	3) It provides a greater coverage on testing both code and development processes.
	
	As a designer, find a developer with a public server and an open mind.
	Get admin privilege and start messing around.
	Ask things, test things, request features...
	
	Graphics? You're out of luck. Maybe you can do some css.

	As a player, find a public server and play.
	Tell the developers about bugs.
	Request features.
	Roleplay to the best of your ability.
	Find the meaning of life.
	
	One public server is running at http://morzo.trezker.net/
	Be aware though that I published just to demonstrate what is done.
	Otherwise people would have to install their own server from scratch just to evaluate the project.
	There is nothing fun to do in the game yet, all I have so far is a foundation.
